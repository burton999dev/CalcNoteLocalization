    CalcNote is an application that combines the respective functions of a calculator and a text editor.
    For this reason, the text resources include both terms used in calculator applications and those used in text editors.
    A short and simple translation with as formal of expressions as possible is desirable.
    The character limit is the number of characters for half-width characters. For double-byte characters such as Japanese and Chinese, this is halved.
